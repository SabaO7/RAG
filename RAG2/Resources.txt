Overview of RAG: 
> Its a framework that combines the capabilities of two different types of models: a retriever model and a generator model. The RAG approach is particularly used in natural language processing tasks that benefit from external knowledge or information retrieval, such as question answering or fact verification.
> Retrieval-augmented generation (“RAG”) models combine the powers of pretrained dense retrieval (DPR) and Seq2Seq models.

    * RAG pipeline includes that the input goes to an embedding model
